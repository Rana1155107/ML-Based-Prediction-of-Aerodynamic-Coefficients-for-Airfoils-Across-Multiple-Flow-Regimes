# ML-Based-Prediction-of-Aerodynamic-Coefficients-for-Airfoils-Across-Multiple-Flow-Regimes
This project applies machine learning to predict airfoil lift and drag coefficients using flow conditions and geometric parameters. Multiple regression models are compared to capture nonlinear aerodynamic behavior, providing fast and accurate surrogate models for aerodynamic analysis.
